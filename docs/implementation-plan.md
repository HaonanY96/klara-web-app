# Implementation Plan

Kino Design & MVP Plan
Goal Description
Design the MVP and Visual Identity for Kino, a lightweight AI companion. The goal is to create a product that feels "warm, human, and stress-free," avoiding the cold, productivity-obsessed feel of traditional to-do apps.

User Review Required
IMPORTANT

Please review the Visual Identity and MVP Scope sections below. I have selected a "Warm Minimalism" aesthetic.

Kino UI Mockup

Visual Identity: "Warm Minimalism"
Core Philosophy
Non-intrusive: The UI should feel like a quiet room, not a cockpit.
Organic: Use natural colors and soft shapes.
Text-Centric: Content comes first; UI elements recede.
Color Palette
We will use a palette inspired by natural materials (paper, stone, clay).

Role Color Name Hex Code Usage
Background Paper Cream #FDFCF8 Main page background. Avoids harsh pure white.
Surface Soft Stone #F2F0E9 Cards, input fields, sidebar.
Text Primary Ink Gray #3E3C38 Main headings and body text. Softer than black.
Text Secondary Pencil Gray #75736D Subtitles, hints, timestamps.
Accent Clay Warmth #D48C70 Primary actions, highlights, "active" states.
Success Sage Leaf #8DA399 Completion checks, positive feedback.
Focus Muted Blue #8FA9BC Selection, focus states (optional).
Typography
Headings: Lora (Serif). Adds a touch of literary/human warmth.
Body/UI: Inter or Outfit (Sans-serif). Clean, legible, modern but friendly.
UI Elements
Shapes: Generous border radius (12px - 16px) for cards and inputs.
Shadows: Very soft, diffused shadows (box-shadow: 0 4px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.03)).
Motion: Slow, gentle transitions (ease-out, 300ms+).
MVP Scope (Minimum Viable Product)
We will focus on the "Clarity Companion" aspect, stripping away complex project management.

1. The "Quiet" Input (Capture)
   A central, simple input field: "What's on your mind?"
   Supports capturing:
   Tasks: "Buy milk"
   Thoughts: "I feel anxious about the deadline"
   AI Magic: Kino analyzes the input.
   If it's a task -> Adds to Task List.
   If it's a thought -> Saves to "Reflections".
2. The "Clarity" List (Tasks)
   No complex sorting: Tasks are auto-sorted by Kino (Importance x Urgency) but displayed simply.
   Blind-Spot Hints: When hovering a task, show 1-2 sub-steps (generated by AI).
   Visuals: Simple list, clean typography. No checkboxes (maybe a gentle "done" swipe or click).
3. Reflection Moment
   A dedicated "Reflection" tab.
   Shows a daily prompt (e.g., "What went well today?").
   Displays insights from previous entries.
   Proposed Tech Stack
   Framework: Next.js (App Router)
   Styling: Tailwind CSS (configured with custom colors/fonts)
   State: LocalStorage (for MVP privacy/speed) + Context API
   AI: Google Gemini Flash (via API)
   Verification Plan
   Visual Check
   Verify the "Paper Cream" background reduces eye strain compared to pure white.
   Check that the "Clay Warmth" accent feels inviting, not urgent (like red).
   Ensure typography is readable and hierarchical.
   Functional Check
   Input captures text and clears.
   "Tasks" and "Thoughts" are stored separately (simulated logic for now).
